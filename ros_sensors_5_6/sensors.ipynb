At each time step, it` approximates the non-linear system` with a `linear one` around the `current state estimate` using `*Jacobian`. This allows it to apply the same `predict-and-update cycle` as the standard Kalman Filter.\n",

    "- `Prediction`: The EKF predicts the system's next state based on its current estimate and a motion model. This prediction inherently includes some uncertainty.\n",

In this case the robot is unable to move and the wheels are slipping. The raw odometry believes from the encoder signals that the robot is still moving on a curve while the odometry after the ekf sensor fusion will believe that the robot moves forward straight. Although none of them are correct, but remember, `neither the IMU and neither the odometry` can tell if the robot is doing an `uniform movement` or it's `stand still`. At least the ekf is able to properly tell that the robot's orientation is not changing regardless what the encoders measure."

    "\n",
    "1. In the `ToF` (Time of Flight) method (OS1), the LiDAR transmitter emits a pulse, hits an object and returns, and the receiver receives the return wave and calculates the difference in reception time between the two, and multiplies it by the speed of light to achieve distance measurement between objects.\n",

    "    - Where d is the distance between the object and the LiDAR, c is the speed of light, and t is the round-trip time of the pulse (ToF).\n",

Since the frequency of the source beam is constantly changing, differences in beam transmission distance result in differences in frequency. After mixing the echo signal with the local oscillation signal and low-pass filtering, the resulting differential frequency signal is a function of the beam round-trip time. The FM continuous wave LiDAR will not be interfered by other LiDAR or sunlight and has no range blindness; it can also measure the speed and distance of objects using Doppler shift. The FM continuous wave LiDAR concept is not new, but faces a number of technical challenges, such as the linewidth limitation of the emitted laser, the frequency range of the linear FM pulses, the linearity of the linear pulse frequency variation, and the reproducibility of individual linear FM pulses.\n",
